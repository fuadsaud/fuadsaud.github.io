## Hi there

I'm a 20 years old software developer and computer geek from
[Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul)
living in {{site.author.location}}. I'm currently studying abroad in the
U.S and working as a Research Assistant for the [WISDM Lab](//wisdmproject.com)
at [Fordham University](//fordham.edu) - until August -, after having attended
[Rochester Institute of Technology's Computer Science program](//cs.rit.edu)
for a year.

I've been working with software development since 2012 and I really like it.
Most of what I did since then is web development involving technologies like
**Ruby** and **JavaScript** and **MongoDB** but I'm also interested in things
such as functional programming - I've been playing with **Clojure** and
**Haskell** for a while and I really want to spend more time mastering these
tools-, data analysis - I have some knowledge in **data mining** from college
courses that I still didn't have the chance to put to work in non-college
related tasks - and artificial intelligence - same goes for **machine
learning**, which I think is an awesome field I'd like to explore more.

I also like **football** - mostly the one played with the feet but have been
learning about the one played with the hands lately -, **music** - many genres but
mostly indie and folk rock - and **coffee**.

I <del>should be blogging</del> blog at [fuad.im](//fuad.im).

non-degree exchange program sponsored by the Brazilian Government.

At [Unisinos](//unisinos.br/global/en/) since March 2011. I'm hopefully
