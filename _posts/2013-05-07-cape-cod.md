Howdy!

I just released the second version of **Cape Cod**, a ruby gem for dealing with
ANSI escape codes.

You can check the code, docs and usage [here](//github.com/fuadsaud/cape-cod).

### Why?

Well, there are already plenty of gems that do exactly the same thing: append
some weird chars to your strings; why, would I want another one?

Different people, different tastes. Some like to do it the block way, some by
monkey patching, etc; each of the existing gems provide one of these ways, but
they're all kind of abandoned and featuring some lingering issues.

Cape Cod should be compatible with most part of the existing api's out there,
so if you want to use it, it ain't gonna be a pain in the ass to adapt your
code.

My goal is to keep it compatible and support all the common ways for dealing
with ANSI escapes sequences.

### Installation

As usual, add this to your Gemfile:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'cape-cod'
{% endhighlight %}

then run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

Or simply:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install cape-cod
{% endhighlight %}

Use it, and contribute back!
