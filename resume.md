### Hi there

I'm a 19 years old software developer and computer geek living in the
Rochester, NY area.

I'm an avid learner, self-taught programmer, and I've been working with
software for about 2 years.

I do a lot of Ruby programming these days, because it's what I'm pretty used to
(it's in the comfort zone), but I've been playing more with JavaScript and
Clojure laately and I want to invest more time working with some of these
technologies in the near future. I have some (not really joyful) experience
with Java and C++ (mainly because of college work).

I <del>should be blogging more</del> blog at [fuad.im](//fuad.im).

### Where I've been studying

####**Computer Science Sandwich Graduation**

At [RIT](//rit.edu) since August 2014. I'm studying abroad at the Rochester
Institute of Technology, in Rochester, NY, as part of a one year long
non-degree exchange program I'm participating in.

####**Computer Science Bachelor**

At [Unisinos](//unisinos.br) since March 2011. I'm in the 7th period (will
hopefully graduate in 2016).

### Where I've been working


### CWI ([cwi.com.br](//cwi.com.br))
#### Software Developer - April 2013 to July 2013

CWI is an IT company that offers software services like Software Factory,
Project Factory, Test Factory and Outsourcing.

There I worked on the team outsourced to iba, a digital content delivery
company.

iba is a young project that focuses on high scale delivery of digital
content like magazines, newspapers and books through mobile, desktop and web
apps.

Stack used there consisted mainly of several Ruby based REST microservices
(developed with the Sinatra framework along with Cucumber and RSpec), backed by
MongoDB and Redis databases on an Amazon infrastructure.

#### Avelã ([avela.me](//avela.me))
##### Software Developer - April 2013 to April 2014

Avelã makes CRM software for medical clinics. I used to deal with a lot of
legacy code and refactor apps written using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and MySQL
databases.

#### Ocapi ([www.ocapi.com.br](//www.ocapi.com.br))
##### Software Developer - July 2012 to January 2013

Ocapi is a company focused on building solutions for e-commerces and digital
marketing.

It was an awesome internship. I worked developing new systems and features for
company's products (mostly Ruby on Rails applications) and on the maintenance
of existing projects. I learned tons of things during this period, and it was
essential for my professional base.

#### Cali ([www.cali.com.br](//www.cali.com.br))
##### Support Assistant and Software Developer

Cali is a small company developing softwares for automation and management of
metrology and calibration labs.

This was my first formal employment. I worked mainly finding and correcting bugs
on company's softwares and extending it's functionalities, remote deployment,
etc. Pretty boring but it was enough to get started.
