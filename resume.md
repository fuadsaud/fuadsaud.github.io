### Hi there

I'm an 18 years old software developer living in São Leopoldo, Brazil.

I'm an avid learner, self-taught programmer, and I've been working with
software for about 2 years.

I do a lot of Ruby these days, because it's what I'm pretty used to (it's in
the comfort zone), but I've been playing more with JavaScript, Clojure and
Elixir lately and I want to invest more time working with some of these
technologies in the near future. I have some (not really joyful) experience
with Java and C++ (mainly because of college work).

I <del>should be blogging more</del> blog at [fuad.im](//fuad.im).

### Where I've been studying

####**Computer Science Bachelor**

At [Unisinos](//unisinos.br) since March 2011. I'm in the 6th period (will
hopefully graduate in 2015).

### Where I've been working

#### Avelã ([avela.me](//avela.me))
##### Software Developer - Since April 2013

Avelã makes CRM software for medical clinics. I deal with a lot of legacy code
and refactoring apps written using Ruby on Rails.

#### Ocapi ([www.ocapi.com.br](//www.ocapi.com.br))
##### Software Developer - July 2012 to January 2013

Ocapi is a company focused on building solutions for e-commerces and digital
marketing.

It was an awesome internship. I worked developing new systems and features for
company's products (mostly Ruby on Rails applications) and on the maintenance
of existing projects. I learned tons of things during this period, and it was
essential for my professional base.

#### Cali ([www.cali.com.br](//www.cali.com.br))
##### Support Assistant and Software Developer

Cali is a small company developing softwares for automation and management of
metrology and calibration labs.

This was my first formal employment. I worked mainly finding and correcting bugs
on company's softwares and extending it's functionalities, remote deployment,
etc. Pretty boring but it was enough to get started.
